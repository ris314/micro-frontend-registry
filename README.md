# micro-frontend-registry
Gain visibility into available micro frontends and learn about how to implement one.

**NOTE: this is a prototype!**

# Installing
Pull down the repository locally, and then from your terminal `cd` into the project directory and run the install command:
```sh
npm install
```

# Running
From the project directory within the terminal run:
```sh
npm start
```

**NOTE:**
The prototype relies on [Ilya Sterin](https://github.com/isterin-mdsol)'s [microfrontends](https://github.com/isterin-mdsol/microfrontends) for displaying microfrontends defined elsewhere.
Please follow his readme to run this dependency locally. You may opt out from running his microfrontends, but please be aware that if you do so, will only be able to see the Guides section and nothing will be rendered in the Registry section.

# Usage
With the web app running locally, you will be able to interact with it from your browser at http://localhost:6006/.
