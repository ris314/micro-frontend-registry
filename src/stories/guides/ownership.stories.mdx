# Ownership
The team, who implemented a piece of functionality from their web application as a micro-frontend, owns it. They should think of it as a functionality, whose users are other teams in the organization. It is critical that the micro-frontend be stable and available at all times, and that any changes be planned in advance and are accomplished via deprecation first and then obsoletion.
