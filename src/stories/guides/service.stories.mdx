# Service
Each micro-frontend's source code is defined and unit tested in its origin application.

Micro-frontends should be served from the same source domain as its origin web application and be accessible via the URL as a [Javascript IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE) containing the bundled and minified code, which exposes relevant assets as [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components).

There should be at least three environments serving the micro-frontend:
* Sandbox
* UAT/Validation
* Production

Each of the environments above should conform to Infosec requirements around data availability, authentication & authorization, etc.
