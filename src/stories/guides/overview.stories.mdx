# Overview
Micro-frontend architecture is a software design pattern in which web applications are decomposed into smaller chunks, whereby each chunk can be invoked together with other chunks or as a standalone micro application within another (macro) application.

Our implementation strategy for micro-frontends is to rely on [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components). Specifically, we are targeting the [shadow DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM) to encapsulate our reusable web application chunks.

In order for this pattern to be successful across teams and products within the organization, we must establish and adhere to a set of guidelines and principles.
